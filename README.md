# PrivacyPreserveNet-Privacy-preserving-interpretable-deep-learning-model-for-AMD-DME-classification
Ocular diseases, especially AMD and DME have been one of the major retinal diseases affecting the human eye and causing blindness. Hence, the development of diagnosis tools for early detection of ocular diseases with high accuracy is of great importance. The existing diagnosis tools for these diseases come up with various challenges due to manual errors and confined medical facilities. Considering such challenges, a novel method based on deep learning model named PrivacyPreserveNet has been developed in this study. The developed model has been experimented on two public datasets (OCT_Tehran and OCT_DUKE). Along with mitigating privacy loss and data exposure, this model can provide sufficient accuracy and privacy. It was also found that the GradCAM can boost up our modelâ€™s interpretability to demonstrate the salient regions of the images that mostly contribute to the prediction made in terms of classifying the AMD, DME and normal groups. The results obtained by our developed model were compared with the results of three existing models (VGG16, ResNetV2 and Inception_V3). The comparison results revealed that our model provides high accuracy and ROC_AUC score of 0.9677 and 0.997 for dataset-1 and 0.9856 and 0.9998 for dataset-2, respectively.
